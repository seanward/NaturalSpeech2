This is a work in progress repo, which is the output from an experimental AI code generation platform which can translate computer science papers directly into code. In this case, the input is the recent paper on NaturalSpeech 2 from Microsoft Research [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.09116.pdf)

Current AI Todo List:
To complete this module, you'll need to integrate the SpeechPrompter class into your existing project and create appropriate training and inference pipelines. Here are the general steps to follow:

    Preprocessing: Ensure you have preprocessed your dataset into the required format (e.g., speech waveforms, durations, and pitches) and split it into training and validation sets.

    Instantiate Models: Instantiate the diffusion model, pitch predictor, and duration predictor that will be passed to the SpeechPrompter class.

    Instantiate SpeechPrompter: Create a SpeechPrompter instance, passing the required arguments, including the instantiated models and the prompt lengths for training and inference.

    DataLoader: Create data loaders for your training and validation sets, so that they can be used during the training and evaluation loops.

    Optimizer: Set up an optimizer (e.g., Adam) to optimize the parameters of the diffusion model, pitch predictor, and duration predictor.

    Training Loop: Implement a training loop that:
        Loads batches of data (speech, durations, pitches)
        Calls the forward pass of the SpeechPrompter with the 'training' mode
        Computes the loss
        Performs backpropagation and updates the model parameters

    Validation Loop: Implement a validation loop that:
        Loads batches of data (speech, durations, pitches)
        Calls the forward pass of the SpeechPrompter with the 'training' mode
        Computes the validation loss
        Keeps track of the best validation loss and saves the model checkpoint when a new best is found

    Inference Function: Implement an inference function that:
        Loads a pre-trained model checkpoint
        Calls the forward pass of the SpeechPrompter with the 'inference' mode
        Generates the full speech waveform from the short input prompt

    Evaluation Metrics: Include evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the model, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or other relevant metrics for your specific use case.

    Logging and Visualization: Implement logging and visualization tools (e.g., TensorBoard) to monitor the training process, visualize the loss curves, and observe the generated speech waveforms.

Once you have completed these steps, your module should be ready for training, validation, and inference. Ensure that you fine-tune the hyperparameters to achieve the desired performance.
